# Archived docs

Older or one-off docs kept for reference. For current setup and behavior use:

- [How to Build and Deploy](../HOW_TO_BUILD_AND_DEPLOY.md)
- [Implementation status (A2A)](../implementation-status-distributed-business-agent-a2a.md)
- [Development Environment](../DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT.md), [Database Setup](../DATABASE_SETUP.md), [Environment Variables](../ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md)

Archived here: implementation reviews, prerequisite status, UCP/experience-tag/LLM/testing one-offs, pending-features and development-setup plans that are now covered by the canonical docs above.
